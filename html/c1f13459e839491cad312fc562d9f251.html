<p><b>Step 1:&nbsp;</b>Download the Analysis folder from the simulator tab. The download will be in zip format. Extract the downloaded zip file. You will get a folder scilab-codes-analysis.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:&nbsp;</b>Open the scilab-codes-analysis folder and then locate and open the folder Sine_Analysis .</p>
<p><b>Step 3:&nbsp;</b>Copy the sine test data in to this folder.</p>
<p><b>Step 4:&nbsp;</b>Change the Scilab working directory Sine_Analysis folder.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:&nbsp;</b>Open the file sine-analysis.sce in scilab editor and enter the name of the data file (with extention) in the filename field.</p>
<p><b>Step 6:&nbsp;</b>Put the value of frequency f for the calculation of amplitude ratio and phase di erence and execute it. Here f means input frequency.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:&nbsp;</b>Expect the values of amplitude ratio and phase difference on the scilab console.</p>
