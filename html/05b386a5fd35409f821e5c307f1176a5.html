<p><b>Installation-</b></p>
<ol>
<li>cd scilab-codes-linux</li>
<li>chmod 777 install.sh</li>
<li>./install</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Step 1:&nbsp;</b>Open the SineTest experiment directory</p>
<p><b>Step 2:&nbsp;</b>Double-click on the file run. Expect the SBHS cient application to open.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:&nbsp;</b>Enter the username and password inside the SBHS cient application and press login button. Expect the message "Ready to execute scilab code"</p>
<p><b>Step 4:&nbsp;</b>Switch to the SineTest experiment directory and double-click on the file sinetest.sce. This will launch scilab and also open the file sinetest.sce in the scilab editor. Linux users will have to launch scilab manually. They also have to change the working directory to SineTest and then open the sinetest.sce file in the scilab editor.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:&nbsp;</b>Switch to the scilab console and execute the command getd ../common-files.</p>
<p><b>Step 6:&nbsp;</b>Execute the file sinetest.sce. Expect the sine test xcos diagram to open automatically. If this doesnt happen, check the scilab console for error message.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:&nbsp;</b>Execute the step test xcos daiagram. You may change the input parameters, if required, before executing. Expect a plot window to open automatically showing three graphs.</p>
<p><b>Step 8:&nbsp;</b>Stop the Xcos simulation after the experiment is completed properly.</p>
<p><b>Step 9:&nbsp;</b>Go to the SineTest folder. Here you will find a logs folder. This folder will have another folder named after your username. It will have the log file for your experiment. Read the log file name as YearMonthDatehoursminutesseconds.txt. This log file contains all the values of heat fan and temperature. It can be used for further analysis.</p>
