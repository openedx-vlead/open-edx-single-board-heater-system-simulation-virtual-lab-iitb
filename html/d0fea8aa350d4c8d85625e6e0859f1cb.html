<p><b>Installation-</b></p>
<ol>
<li>cd scilab-codes-linux</li>
<li>chmod 777 install.sh</li>
<li>./install</li>
</ol>
<p><b>Step 1:&nbsp;</b>The working directory is pid_controller. Open this directory.</p>
<p><b>Step 2:&nbsp;</b>Double-click on the file run. Expect the SBHS cient application to open.</p>
<p><b>Step 3:&nbsp;</b>Enter the username and password inside the SBHS client application and press login button. Expect the message "Ready to execute scilab code".</p>
<p><b>Step 4:&nbsp;</b>Switch to the PID controller experiment directory and double-click on the file pi_ta_virtual.sce. This will launch scilab and also open the file pi_ta_virtual.sce in the scilab editor. If it doesnt, you will have to start scilab and manually change the working directory to pid_controller and then open the pi_ta_virtual.sce file in the scilab editor.</p>
<p><b>Step 5:&nbsp;</b>Switch to the scilab console and execute the command getd ../common-files.</p>
<p><b>Step 6:&nbsp;</b>Execute the file pi_ta_virtual.sce. Expect the PI controller xcos diagram to open automatically. If this doesn't happen, check the scilab console for error message.</p>
<p><b>Step 7:&nbsp;</b>Execute the PI controller xcos diagram. You may change the proportional and Integral gain parameters, if required, before executing. Expect a plot window to open automatically showing three graphs.</p>
<p><b>Step 8:&nbsp;</b>Stop the Xcos simulation after the experiment is completed properly.</p>
